This repository was made for the Capstone project of Courseraâ€™s IBM Data Science Specialization. Using the Foursquare Developer API, we were asked this week to formulate the beginnings of a Data Science project, starting with the overall problem and background, followed by the description of the data an how it will be used. 
The main machine learning tactic I will use is K-Means Clustering to find similarities in different Canadian cities, both on diversity and immigration-related data, as well as data from Foursquare about the different kind of food places available.
